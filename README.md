# RAW Notepad

*By Roland Waddilove*

This is a simple notes app written in Python. It was a learning exercise - how to write my first GUI app in Python. It uses the built in Tkinter module to create the window, buttons and menus. It is not meant to be a commercial app, but it works OK. It's probably not the best code, but hopefully, it will help others. It works on Windows PC and Apple Mac.

**Update: Notepad 11c.py**: I added multi-document capabilities to the original single-document app. You can now create multiple notes on tabs. A lot of the code is the same as the original version, but it required quite a bit of extra work to make it multi-tab. It's probaly not the best code, but it works. Here's a screenshot of the latest version.

Load and save notes, including fonts and styles.

I couldn't find out how to save the text from a lable/text box including fonts and styles, so I wrote it myself. The code may be of use to you if you are trying to do this.

It does have cut, copy and paste on the Edit menu, but really it is easier to use the keyboard:
Use Ctrl+X, C, V to cut, copy, paste on PC.
Use Cmd+X, C, V to cut, copy, paste on Mac.

*Ideas for future versions: Multiple notes on tabs, printing, Markdown export.*
